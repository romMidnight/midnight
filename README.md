## Hi, I'm Roma ðŸ‘‹

#### I am fond of software development :computer:

I started programming 5 years ago with c/c++, after two years I realized I wanted to spend less time with system environment and more time with business logic.
On quest to find more developer friendly tools, I met javascript, on which I've been coding happily since.

#### I am fond of reading :books:

I enjoy reading, will it be some tool documentation or literature. Generally, human traits and emotions are super interesting things to me, that's why I prefer reading japanese novels. My favorite Japanese novel is [Kokoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoro).

#### I am fond of psychology and spirituality :evergreen_tree:

I try to be more kind, disciplined and efficient. Overpowering your fears and admitting your failures are necessary for moving forward and keeping clarity of mind. My favorite book about human inner workings is [Zen Buddhism and Psychoanalysis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25493.Zen_Buddhism_and_Psychoanalysis).

#### I am fond of art :art:

I am crazy about imagery that challenges our way of perceiving reality. Irrational, shocking, Freudian dream, these words can help you describe what I enjoy: _Surrealism_! My favorite movie is [Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holy_Mountain_(1973_film)>).

## Me as a Software Developer

I have good grasp of computer science fundamentals.I can reason rationally about my project tool choices and write clean, maintainable code. 

While a good team player, I can self-manage myself too. I can communicate and work closely with clients to better understand their needs. 

I am curious, I just love learning, turning everything from inside out and observing every each detail of it. I constantly seek bigger picture, always plan ahead and think about what kind of impact I and my actions will have in present and in the future. 

I'm persistent and can't stand giving up, even when it's not worth trying anymore, at the same time I'm open minded, ready to admit my faults and discuss what should have I done better for myself and others. 

I often experiment and try different things, I want to be _avant-garde_ of software development.
